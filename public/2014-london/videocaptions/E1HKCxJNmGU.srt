1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,900
NATASHA ROONEY: Thank
you so much.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,050
So yeah, we have the exciting
topic of payments left for

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,890
this afternoon.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm sorry, but it's one of
these things that is--

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,240
yeah, I know.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,090
Usually at home, actually, when
we have the last panel,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,360
I'd say, look, I'm sorry for
standing in the way of you

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,170
guys and the pub.

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,510
But we don't really have the pub
here, so I'm sorry we're

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,280
standing in front of you
guys and dinner.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,440
But there is decent beer,
so I suppose that's OK.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,920
And now I'm starting
to sound like an

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,980
alcoholic Brit, so sorry.

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,300
OK, let's move on.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,680
So payments are very,
very important.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,110
I've been speaking a lot with
the W3C people, a lot of

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,940
people that are involved
in standardization.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,780
And we all want to make the web

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,480
better, and that's fantastic.

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,980
But one of the problems
is the money needs

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,480
to come from somewhere.

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,330
We need the funding to
do the cool things

24
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,690
that we want to do.

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,010
So unfortunately, this is just
something that we have to go

26
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,085
and have a chat about.

27
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:00,720
And if you're really into it,
then great because there's a

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,500
lot of money to be
made out of it.

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,010
So cool.

30
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,930
Panelists, we've got Manu
Sporny on my left.

31
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,170
He sits in the W3C and the IETF
doing a lot of work on

32
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,420
standardization on payments
right now and founder of

33
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,590
Digital Bazaar.

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,540
Ricardo, Ricardo from
Telefonica, Ricardo Varela,

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,840
head honcho of the BlueVia
Change to Mobile work and did

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
some stuff on WAC before then.

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,930
Rob Grimshaw, Managing Director
of the Financial

38
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,280
Times is sitting to my right
here, so known for FT's

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,140
pioneering payment models.

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,530
[INAUDIBLE]

41
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,070
a lot of questions for you.

42
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,200
Kumar McMillan right at the
end there from Mozilla,

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,390
working on a lot of things.

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,780
I'm sure you do a lot of stuff
with mozPay and Firefox

45
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,900
Marketplace.

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,740
Excellent.

47
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,500
And Cyndy over here does a lot
of work in Google with Google

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,410
Wallet and the magic
requestAutocomplete, which I'm

49
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,030
sure will come up today.

50
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,850
So Manu is speaking
for us today.

51
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,580
So I'm driver of the slides.

52
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,850
So--

53
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,870
MANU SPORNY: Driver
of the slides.

54
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,320
NATASHA ROONEY: Yeah, I
get all the good jobs.

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,620
Cool.

56
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,919
So take it away.

57
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,280
MANU SPORNY: All right, so this
panel is kind of titled

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,200
payments, but I think it's
far deeper than that.

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,170
I think, when we think payments,
we think getting

60
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,050
payment from customer
to the vendor.

61
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,180
We don't think about, for
example, 30% of the people in

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,660
the United States that currently
don't have a bank

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,010
account that have no
way of saving.

64
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,200
In other nations, it's
even worse than that.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,700
It can be up to 70% of the
population that has no way of

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,460
saving money, putting money
aside, for school, for food,

67
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,530
things of that nature.

68
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,240
So while we're talking about
web payments, I think that

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,620
there's a far deeper and more
important story here.

70
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,350
And that is figuring out a way
to get the web to help people

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,210
that can't save money, that
don't live in countries where

72
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,940
putting money in a bank is a
feasible solution for them.

73
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,390
So this isn't just about
paying for products.

74
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,050
While that's important for all
of us, this isn't just a first

75
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,770
world problem.

76
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,480
It's a problem for people
all around the world.

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,860
So as Natasha said, I am the W3C
chair for the web payments

78
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,170
group right now.

79
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,350
I also deal quite a bit with
linked data, microformats,

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,060
microdata, RDFa, JSON-LD,
things like that.

81
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,680
And I also deal quite a bit with
identity and security,

82
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,700
both at the IETF and the W3C.

83
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,790
And basically, what that means
is I get to see a lot of

84
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,630
different technologies
come by these groups.

85
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,660
And what we're trying to do is
we're trying to pick and

86
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,770
choose which technologies will
probably be good candidates

87
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,610
for integrating into the core
of the web's architecture.

88
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,650
Until now, we really haven't had
a core way of transferring

89
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,600
value around the web, right?

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,670
I mean the thing that we look
at to spend money on the web

91
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,560
right now are to move money back
and forth are things like

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,290
credit cards and ACH, and that's
just not cool anymore.

93
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,910
We have to have a
better solution.

94
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,060
And so I spend a lot of time
kind of championing

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,400
technologies, a lot of the
technologies that our

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,990
panelists are working
on currently.

97
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,930
So we've got a problem
on the web, right?

98
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,070
And that's sending and receiving
money is typically

99
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,120
proprietary.

100
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,610
It's very slow.

101
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,990
It's insecure.

102
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,120
And it is actively hostile
to innovation.

103
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,060
That's the reason that we
don't have very many

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,300
innovative companies in
the payment space.

105
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,510
You can argue that we do, and
I hope that we do get into

106
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,620
that argument on this panel.

107
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,940
But really, when it comes to
making money on the web, many

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,190
of us make--

109
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,970

110
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,170
our jobs are such that we get
paid to work on the web, but

111
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,600
some people don't have the
benefit of working for a large

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,140
company like Google
or Microsoft that

113
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,080
can cover their expenses.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,920
They would like to have
a more direct

115
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,510
relationship with their customers.

116
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,990
And right now, content
monetization on the web is

117
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,860
really hard.

118
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,030
It's really expensive,

119
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,000
especially if you're a merchant.

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,850
You pay thousands of dollars in
fees just for the right to

121
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,760
process credit cards.

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,380
And the reason that is partially
is because a lot of

123
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,170
the payment tech that we use
today on the web was invented

124
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,430
in the '70s.

125
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,110
It's the ACH Automated Clearing
House system.

126
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,120
It's credit cards.

127
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,700
All this stuff is really, really
old legacy stuff that

128
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,430
predates the web by
a large degree.

129
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,830
So I guess it would be good to
kind of take a look at some of

130
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,680
the use cases that we're trying
to address, right?

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,870
Let's ground this discussion.

132
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,230
Payment for physical goods
today is actually--

133
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,390
we do a pretty decent job
at it on the web, right?

134
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,790
I mean, we've got like things
like Google Wallet and PayPal

135
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,330
that you can use to
pay for goods.

136
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,190
We get the goods.

137
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,440
Everyone's kind of
happy, right?

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,640
But when you look at the
merchant side of this,

139
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,780
creating a merchant account to
be able to process credit

140
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,620
cards is very expensive.

141
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,110
There are a lot of fees
attached to it.

142
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,210
Even when you have a really
good merchant provider,

143
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,260
payment provider, it's still
an awful process for folks

144
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,390
that are kind of mom and
pop shops that try to

145
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,475
set up on the web.

146
00:06:37,475 --> 00:06:39,980
You're usually locked into
a payment processor

147
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,830
when you pick them.

148
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,720
There's no such thing as data
portability, or if there is,

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,550
it's really kind of terrible.

150
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,060
Doing things like in-app
payments right now, you're

151
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,560
usually tied to a particular app
store of some kind, either

152
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
the iTunes Store or the
Google Play Store

153
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,830
or things like that.

154
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,010
And doing things like crowd
funding and crowd loaning on

155
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,810
yourself or by yourself instead
of going through

156
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,680
Kickstarter, which takes 10%
of the money that you make.

157
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,930
You can't do that, right?

158
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,590
And these are things that at
least some of us in the web

159
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,810
payments group think should be
fundamental rights, not just

160
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,320
in the US, but around
the world.

161
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,450
You should be able to be in
charge of your own financial

162
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,960
well-being.

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,280
So I guess that the core here
that we're talking about at

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,320
this panel is three different
categories of things, three

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,370
different ways that we spend
money on the web, three

166
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,060
different ways of
raising money.

167
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,170
And the first one is kind of
the old money, the popular

168
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,680
proprietary category, right?

169
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,390
This is most of the payment
services that

170
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,780
we have right now.

171
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,160
And this is absolutely not a
slam to any of the companies

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,170
that are on this slide.

173
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,680
These companies solve a very
important problem, which is it

174
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,630
really sucks to do transactions
over the web

175
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,650
using your credit
card and ACH.

176
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,180
So we've got PayPal, Amazon
Payments, Google Wallet, even

177
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,320
the new poster children for
really cool payment startups,

178
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,740
like Stripe, Square,
[? Paymentwall, ?]

179
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,860
and sites like Kickstarter,
Indiegogo, and Crowdtilt,

180
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,230
these are all based on this
really horrible old legacy

181
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,010
system, right?

182
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,500
There are tons and tons of
problems that we'll go into

183
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,540
during the discussion today.

184
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,160
So that's kind of the
first category.

185
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
This is what's kind of
popular right now.

186
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,010
The next category is
online app stores.

187
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,390
So these are other types of
kind of proprietary silos.

188
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,059
They lock you in Apple,
the Apple iTunes

189
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,390
store, the Apple store.

190
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,650
Facebook credits, which used
to exist when these slides

191
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,280
were made, but doesn't
exist anymore.

192
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,750
They were just shut down
a little while ago.

193
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,690
The Windows Store, Google Play,
these are all kind of

194
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,590
examples of stores that give
really great kind of user

195
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,650
experiences, but you're kind of
locked into them when you

196
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,380
use them, right?

197
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,160
There's the idea of having this
open app marketplace, has

198
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,340
been talked about, and luckily
for us, I think, Mozilla has

199
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,300
been doing some really great
work in this area, making it

200
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,350
so that you can sell web
apps from any website.

201
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,480
You don't have to go through
an app store

202
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
of one kind or another.

203
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,330
And so the final category, I
think, is predominantly what

204
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,980
I'm really excited about.

205
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,020
This is what gives me hope.

206
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,920
And so the last bit are these
Open Web payment solutions.

207
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,350
Finally, people are starting
to work on things that fit

208
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,650
very nicely with the web.

209
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,030
They don't try and shim the
old 1970s credit card

210
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,620
architecture into the web.

211
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,930
They are a new way of looking at
payments on the web, where

212
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,800
payments are instantaneous,
there's a lot of rich metadata

213
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,530
that goes with it.

214
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,110
So FirefoxOS is doing
a great job with

215
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,360
their marketplace stuff.

216
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,660
We have PaySwarm, which is the
first universal payment

217
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,190
standard for the web.

218
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,130
Bitcoin, I'm sure many of you
have heard of Bitcoin.

219
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,380
How many of you have
heard of Ripple?

220
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,820

221
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,610
Wow.

222
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,430
I was just at a banking
conference last week and half

223
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,530
the bankers raised
their hands.

224
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,350
So that's surprising.

225
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,050
That never happens.

226
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,560
So anyway, Ripple was built
by the Bitcoin folks.

227
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,050
It's kind of a better
version of Bitcoin.

228
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,710
But these there all really cool
technologies that are

229
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,020
native to the web that
are really going to

230
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,650
shake things up.

231
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,220
I think they're really going
to finally bring kind of

232
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,030
payments into the modern age.

233
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,030
So I guess the goal here, what
we're trying to do, is we're

234
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,030
trying to integrate open payment
technology into the

235
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,810
core architecture of the web.

236
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,140
We did this for communication
with email.

237
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Email's got protocols.

238
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,070
The reason that it's so easy
to type in a person's email

239
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,290
address and send a message
halfway around the world is

240
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,380
there's a whole set of
protocols around it.

241
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,530
No such thing exists for
payments on the web.

242
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,250
It's just starting with that
kind of Bitcoin and Ripple

243
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,520
coming along.

244
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,770
But we really need
to work on it.

245
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,810
And that's what we focus
on at the web payments

246
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,580
group, at the W3C.

247
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,850
Most of the panel members
here are a part of the

248
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,970
web payments group.

249
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,270
It's completely open.

250
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,220
We really need developers
to join.

251
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,610
So if you're interested in any
of the stuff that you hear on

252
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,260
the panel today, please join.

253
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,390
Jump onto the group and join.

254
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,940
If you just Google
web payments W3C.

255
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,890
And if you want to talk about
this stuff, pull me aside and

256
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,630
introduce yourself.

257
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,010
I love talking about
this stuff.

258
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,580
So please, at the party after
this, pull me aside if you're

259
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,490
interested in any of the stuff
that you hear on the panel, as

260
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,710
well as the rest of the
panelists here.

261
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,300
So quickly in closing, there's
a whole bunch of contact info

262
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,570
for you to get in touch if
you're interested in payments

263
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,530
or interested in actually taking
part in this work.

264
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,640
There's a lot of good that
you can do here.

265
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,380
This is world-changing stuff.

266
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,660
Twitter, G+ handle email, and
the slides are posted up

267
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,290
there, payswarm.com/slides.

268
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,900
So without further ado, let's
get into the discussion.

269
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,112
NATASHA ROONEY: Fantastic.

270
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:03,940
[APPLAUSE]

271
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,370
NATASHA ROONEY: So thank you
very much for that, Manu.

272
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,870
And with that, like you said,
we'll kick off with the first

273
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,620
question, which comes
from Ada Edwards.

274
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,055
I believe you're reading
out this one.

275
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:14,510
ADA EDWARDS: [INAUDIBLE].

276
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,190
NATASHA ROONEY: Oh, actually,
could we just wait for a mic?

277
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,440
Thanks.

278
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,010

279
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,100
ADA EDWARDS: So I have
a question from a

280
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,350
certain Andrew [? Bet. ?]

281
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,270

282
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:24,710
[INAUDIBLE]

283
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,670
a prepaid account with a
merchant to fund micropayments

284
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,360
is free money for
the merchant.

285
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,930
Why would they kill the golden
goose by moving to instant

286
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,180
micropayments?

287
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,730

288
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,050
MANU SPORNY: So I can jump in.

289
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,830
NATASHA ROONEY: Yeah,
go for it.

290
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,300
MANU SPORNY: I don't know if I
quite agree with the question,

291
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,450
meaning that I think it's
shortsighted for any merchant

292
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,260
to think of it as-- anybody
that's not large.

293
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,690
So Google can think
in that way.

294
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,680
Google can say, I'm going to
require someone to prefund an

295
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,440
account, and then across all the
Google properties, you can

296
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,160
buy things.

297
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,220
Your mom and pop web store,
someone doing like a niche

298
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,510
site, is never going to
be able to do that.

299
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,520
Or if they're going to do that,
they're going to lose

300
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,610
quite a bit of business.

301
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,390
Because I guess ThemeForest is
a great example of this.

302
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,940
They require you to put in
like $5 or $10, but their

303
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,830
themes cost $1.24.

304
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,260
And you have to kind of be--

305
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,790
at least, I was when I bought
one of the themes off them.

306
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,650
I was pretty desperate.

307
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,930
I was really looking
for a theme.

308
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,760
I was under a deadline.

309
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,460
I was like, fine.

310
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,340
Here's $5.

311
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,490
And a lot of my money is kind
of sitting there still.

312
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,850
So I'm a bit ticked at
them for that, right?

313
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,830
I wish I could have just gone to
the site, spent $1.24, and

314
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,640
gone somewhere else.

315
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,110
And I think that is the model
that we really should be

316
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,130
shooting for on the web.

317
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,890
You should be able to go to a
site, just click a Buy button.

318
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,480
You don't have to sign
up for an account.

319
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,420
You don't have to put in your
credit card information.

320
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,590
Just click Buy.

321
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,700
The browser takes care of
the vast majority of

322
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,070
the payment for you.

323
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,310
It's ease of use.

324
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,020
And I think micropayments is
kind of a part of that.

325
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,600
You don't want to be charging
people like $0.02 or $0.03 at

326
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,470
a time, but the idea that you
should be able to do a $1.25

327
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,495
transaction I don't
think is crazy.

328
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:08,810
I think we should be able
to do that on the web.

329
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,650
NATASHA ROONEY: Does anybody
feel any differently

330
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,500
regarding--

331
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,910
RICARDO VARELA: I was actually
going to comment one thing.

332
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,000
So first, actually, if I could
do a bit of a survey, how many

333
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,050
people actually take payments
on the web?

334
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,090
How many people have a product
that actually takes payment?

335
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,570
[INAUDIBLE]

336
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:20,820
one.

337
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,870
And regarding the Ripple
question, how many people know

338
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,630
Bitcoin, for example?

339
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,060
Everybody.

340
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,520
[INAUDIBLE].

341
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,220
Good.

342
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,000
So the thing that I was going to
mention is that one of the

343
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,540
problems that we have
had with payments--

344
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,220
I've been working in
payments for years.

345
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,350
And when I got in, I worked
with mobile operators.

346
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,330
Which, if they're good at
something, is basically at

347
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,170
taking your money, as
you probably know.

348
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,020
So has anybody never
received a charge

349
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,830
from a mobile operator?

350
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,540
The bill always gets
there, right?

351
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,570
And I thought that actually we
had our staff better sorted

352
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,310
out than when I actually
got there.

353
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,500
And in payments, the main
problem is a domain-specific

354
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,380
problem, and it's a heavily
regulated domain as well.

355
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,320
So, for example, why would
somebody want to preload an

356
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,560
account and then take your money
from there and actually

357
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,170
make that charge of fees
in that transaction?

358
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,210
Because there are different
roles in payments.

359
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,870
So actually, when a
payment occurs, it

360
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,520
hasn't really occurred.

361
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,080
It occurs in different phases.

362
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,880
So when you, for example, pay
something with a credit card,

363
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,030
that money's not yet in
the merchant account.

364
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,920
That money has got to go from
bank to bank, normally through

365
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,730
a series, if not only
one, clearinghouses.

366
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,770
And then that ends up
in the other bank.

367
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,530
So basically, that means
that that bank hasn't

368
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,920
actually got paid.

369
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,140
There's actually a risk that
that money never gets paid.

370
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,990
And that is what normally the
issuer bank calls bad debt.

371
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,890
So when you, for example, prepay
an account, what that

372
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,510
merchant that acquiring in that
case is actually trying

373
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,420
to do is reduce their
bad debt problem.

374
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,820
They're trying to say,
I've got the funds.

375
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,980
So if actually this transaction
occurs, I'm going

376
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,720
to automatically pay myself.

377
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,830
Thank you very much.

378
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,550
So that actually occurs whenever
two parties in a

379
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,050
transaction don't have trust
in between them.

380
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,520
And this is a concept that I
suppose we'll go back and back

381
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,540
again in the panel because
payments is all about trust.

382
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,150
If I actually emailed you and
tell you, would you lend me

383
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,000
$20, and you actually give me
$20, that is actually a

384
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,030
transaction that has occurred.

385
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,340
Maybe I don't even have my
money, but you've promised me

386
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,900
that you're going
to pay me $20.

387
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,020
Then I get my $20.

388
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,710
At some point, I may pay
you back or not.

389
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,870
You never know.

390
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,420
So that is [? actionary ?]

391
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,120
transaction.

392
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,430
That actually happens.

393
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,640
So the concept of you pay
me, the concept of you

394
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,430
establishing my identity via
receiving an email from me,

395
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,930
which by the way is not
something that you should

396
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,700
trust probably--

397
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,960
SMTP is not the most secure
thing in the world--

398
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
those things are what actually
happens in payments.

399
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,770
And I think we still don't have
a full solution to model

400
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,870
all that complexity technically
in the web.

401
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,130
And that's one of the products
we're trying to deal with.

402
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,220
NATASHA ROONEY: I think I
actually owe Andrew [? Bet ?]

403
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,420
$20, so we'll see if he does
or does not get that money.

404
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,590
So we actually have a question
from the floor.

405
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,010
So Alex Sexton, [INAUDIBLE]

406
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,670
over there guys.

407
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,190
ALEX SEXTON: Hello.

408
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,980
Full disclosure, Stripe
employee.

409
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,109
NATASHA ROONEY: Oh, actually,
for the floor, do you mind

410
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,140
just explaining what Stripe
is, just in case?

411
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,290
ALEX SEXTON: Stripe is a company
that currently does

412
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,609
payments for the web.

413
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,270
So I think we're in the
first slide along

414
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,960
with many other companies.

415
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,970
So I think me and my friends
would all agree that stuff

416
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,890
like Ripple and Bitcoin is
really cool and totally this

417
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,890
cool, federated way
of doing payments.

418
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,420
But the bootstrapping
of that system is

419
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,600
the blocker, I think.

420
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,360
So how do you get my
parents to be able

421
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,100
to deal with Bitcoin?

422
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,280
You're talking about,
I don't want to

423
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:42,870
sign up for an account.

424
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,120
I don't want to do any
of this stuff.

425
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,370
I just want to hit this button,
and money changes

426
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,210
hands, and there aren't any
of these old systems.

427
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,050
So how do you rewire people's
brains to make this much more

428
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,830
complicated system to
them something that

429
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,070
makes sense at all?

430
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,190
MANU SPORNY: I think the short
answer is ease of use, right?

431
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,110
I mean that is the killer app
for all of these payment

432
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,450
technologies, is the ability to
just go to any site, click

433
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,760
the Buy Now button, be shown
what you're going to buy, and

434
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,780
that's it, right?

435
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,560
And it doesn't matter if you're
using Google Wallet.

436
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,880
It doesn't matter if
you're using Stripe

437
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,140
or Paypal or anything.

438
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,230
They're all speaking a fairly
similar payments protocol.

439
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,150
This is kind of what PaySwarm,
that universal payment

440
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,640
standard, is designed to do.

441
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,000
The idea here is that you have
a common payments protocol

442
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,190
that all of the sites use.

443
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,830
So it's open, non-proprietary,
W3C standard.

444
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,210
And then you can
choose, right?

445
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,020
You can pick and choose who's
going to process your payments

446
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,730
for you, if it's going to be
your bank, or if it's going to

447
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,300
be Google Wallet, or if it's
going to be PayPal.

448
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,870
And then the merchant can choose
whoever they want to.

449
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,730
So I think the way that you
bootstrap this stuff is one,

450
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,900
through ease of use, and then
the second thing is you have

451
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,100
to somehow convince vendors
that this is worth doing.

452
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,430
And I think that's going to be
incredibly difficult to do if

453
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,550
Google Wallet, Stripe,
PayPal, don't join

454
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,400
onto the work, right?

455
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
If they continue to do the
proprietary stuff.

456
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,410
NATASHA ROONEY: We'll take one
more comment from Rob, and

457
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,210
then we'll--

458
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,970
ROB GRIMSHAW: I do agree,
actually, with the point of

459
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,760
the question.

460
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,580
Things like Bitcoin, they're
wonderful ideas.

461
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,240
But these things only really
thrive if they're starting

462
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,990
from scratch.

463
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,600
I mean, if you do it in a market
like somewhere like

464
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,880
developing countries like
Kenya or whatever, then

465
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,720
actually you can make something
happen very quickly.

466
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,630
So you've got a system like
Empasa with 17 million users.

467
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,820
But mostly, these people
never had a bank

468
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,960
account in their lives.

469
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,980
So they just accept it as
this is what it is.

470
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,930
For most of the developed
markets that we're dealing

471
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:55,320
with, on a day to day basis,
is a merchant like the FT.

472
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,150
All these people have got their
money in existing bank

473
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,420
accounts stuck in this
1970s system.

474
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,490
And it's not going to
come out quickly.

475
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,610
So for me, the practical
solutions are about mitigating

476
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,220
that existing system of making
it to something which is at

477
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,830
least some way practical from a
web payments point of view,

478
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,540
rather than thinking about how
we can start again through

479
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,560
some of these ideas, which are
wonderful, but to some extent

480
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,620
utopian from the perspective
of today's business.

481
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,260
MANU SPORNY: Just quickly,
Ripple's whole business plan

482
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,140
is to get banks [INAUDIBLE].

483
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,510
NATASHA ROONEY: We'll get to--
yeah, we'll come to Ripple in

484
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,560
the next couple of questions.

485
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,870
But interesting to what Rob
said, I think one of the next

486
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,740
questions is going to make you
touch on those utopian

487
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,610
viewpoints a little bit.

488
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,590
So Teddy Condo, I think, has the
next question for us here.

489
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,840
Thank you.

490
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,310

491
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,010
TEDDY CONDO: So this question
kind of strikes close to home

492
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,490
because I worked in publishing
and media for a good majority

493
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,400
of my career.

494
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,100
And I don't know if we'll have
an answer to it in this forum

495
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,390
because it's a topic that
has fundamental

496
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,360
problems of his own.

497
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,260
However, I'll add a bit to it,
as well as read the question.

498
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,770
What payment model is the one
that will finally make quote,

499
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,700
unquote, "old media" profitable
enough online, and

500
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,390
how soon can we get to that?

501
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,980
And furthermore, do you know
of any media venues,

502
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,680
publishing houses, that are
doing this correctly and are

503
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,730
actually profitable through
a payment model online?

504
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,590
RICARDO VARELA: Well, I think,
Rob, this kind of fits in--

505
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,430
ROB GRIMSHAW: We've done it.

506
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,630
It's fine.

507
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,070
NATASHA ROONEY: So explain
it to us, Rob.

508
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,360
What's it all about?

509
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,336
ROB GRIMSHAW: Well, the sort of
key thing is actually to be

510
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:43,070
bold enough to charge
for your product.

511
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,590
And actually, the world
is prepared to

512
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,900
pay for great content.

513
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,730
And I think we've established
that.

514
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,210
Quite successfully over the past
five years, we've really

515
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,300
pursued this policy of becoming
a company that

516
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,450
generates the majority of its
money from content rather from

517
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,190
advertising.

518
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,840
If you look at ft.com's
finances right now, we

519
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,210
generate in excess of 70% of
our revenues from content,

520
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,140
i.e., subscriptions, of the
vast majority of that page

521
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,070
digitally through our
subscriptions.

522
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:25,520
And that is not an indication
that we lost all our

523
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,600
advertising revenue.

524
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,080
In fact, our advertising grew
over the period of time that

525
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,340
we grew our subscriptions
business.

526
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,340
It's a sign that, actually, if
you have the right offering,

527
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,550
and you do work hard on the
payment side, you can build a

528
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,860
very successful business around
quality content online.

529
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,300
NATASHA ROONEY: Fantastic.

530
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,970
We've got a couple of questions
from the floor.

531
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,630
So Ally, if you want
to raise your hand.

532
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,420

533
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,670
Oh, sorry.

534
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:58,650

535
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,000
ALLY: It's kind of off topic now
because I wanted to speak

536
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,330
actually about the last topic.

537
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,740
Is it OK to go back to that, or
would you rather continue

538
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,470
moving forward?

539
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,990
I guess what I was thinking was
we mentioned, like with

540
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,830
the problem with more widespread
adoption of Bitcoin

541
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,520
being ease of use.

542
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,780
And I just had a gut reaction to
disagree with that because

543
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,320
I think that a much bigger
issue with it, especially

544
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,560
among an older crowd, has to
do with trust issues and

545
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,100
feeling that they can trust
these different sources.

546
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,480
And that was just kind of what
I wanted to bring up, and I'm

547
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,070
wondering kind of how you
address that, and how you make

548
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,980
those older people feel
more comfortable with

549
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,230
these payment options.

550
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,240

551
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,370
CYNDY LOBB: I'm not sure that
they'll ever be comfortable

552
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,640
with them, honestly.

553
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,300
I mean, look at the
supermarket.

554
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,920
When you're standing at the
supermarket, how many older

555
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,210
people use debit cards,
and how many are

556
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,190
still writing checks?

557
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,730
So it might be that that user
behavior is so divergent that

558
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,960
they won't get there, but that
doesn't mean that we should

559
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,390
not continue to push
the envelope.

560
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,980
Like I do believe that Bitcoin
is going to be really

561
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,540
challenging.

562
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,680
I do believe that from a
usability perspective, even

563
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,500
when I read up on it, and
there's big warnings.

564
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,000
Keep your wallet offline.

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,206
I was like, whoa, you know?

566
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:22,870
And I'm a tech person, right?

567
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,230
So the lay person is going to
read that one line that's

568
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,880
right on the Bitcoin website,
and they're going to run.

569
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,070
They're going to run as
fast as they can.

570
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,770
So it's a ver--

571
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,880
this is a social issue as much
as it's a payments issue, and

572
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,820
it's a trust issue.

573
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,100
So payments is that complex
ecosystem of a lot of

574
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,010
different players.

575
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,270
And trying to make everyone
happy is very challenging.

576
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,750
ROB GRIMSHAW: We do live in a
period where the price of gold

577
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,270
is at an all-time high, mainly
because people don't trust

578
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,750
currencies full stop, let alone
new ideas like Bitcoin.

579
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,000
And this is a really difficult,
complex issue for

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,590
societies and economies as a
whole, which people have been

581
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,670
wrestling with for hundreds
of years.

582
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,770
And just kind of introducing
something new into that is not

583
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,610
something that happens
in a couple of months

584
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,630
or a couple of years.

585
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,780
It can take decades, hundreds of
years, to really establish

586
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,730
a new currency properly.

587
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,410
RICARDO VARELA: Also--

588
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,690
sorry, was going to comment
that actually, in payments

589
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,810
recently, we've been actually
talking about how this whole

590
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,470
payments on the web thing should
really be a bit more--

591
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,220
well, some of us think that
this should be more like a

592
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,260
two-face approach.

593
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,160
Essentially, there's no open
technology to basically the

594
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,540
payments on the web
at the moment.

595
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,700
And there's also the whole
virtual currency thing, which

596
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,970
at some point may arrive.

597
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,640
And actually, I think there
will be even government

598
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,760
initiatives to this because
there's lots of benefits about

599
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,830
issuing currency that
is not physical.

600
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,540
But until that moment happens,
basically, that doesn't mean

601
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,170
that you cannot start with the
first part of it, which is

602
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,630
the, OK, how about we have open
technology to do those

603
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,940
payments on the web?

604
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,770
Because sometimes, and we have
that thing in W3C where we

605
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,360
basically go into inventing
problems that you cannot

606
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,830
really solve, not even in
the existent system,

607
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,130
[? emerging ?] on
the new system.

608
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,830
So we try to first have a
system, and then we try to add

609
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,250
things like virtual
currencies on it.

610
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,110
NATASHA ROONEY: So this goes
into the third question, which

611
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,710
came from--

612
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,440
actually, Manu, I believe this
is one of the questions that

613
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,230
you originally asked, so I will
ask it for you, which

614
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,630
actually goes back to the
Bitcoin and Ripple question,

615
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,800
which is do they fit into the
plan for web-based payments,

616
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,160
and should they be included as
payment options, or should

617
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,960
they remain on the periphery?

618
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,010
But it seems like what Ricardo
is talking about now is

619
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,500
they're already being considered
as being wrapped

620
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,540
into the standards.

621
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,660
MANU SPORNY: Yeah, and I really
asked that question

622
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,320
because I was more interested
in the answer from the

623
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,080
panelists, right?

624
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,110
And I wanted to be a bit more
pointed with the question.

625
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,850
Are there definite plans to
integrate alternative

626
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,060
currencies into product lines
like Google Wallet?

627
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,370
Would Google Wallet
ever consider

628
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,580
adding Bitcoin or Ripple?

629
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,060
Would Mozilla consider putting
a Bitcoin wallet or just some

630
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,630
kind of, even a USD wallet,
directly into the browser, so

631
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,670
that when you download a
browser, you've got preloaded

632
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,320
$10 that you can spend
online with it.

633
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,110
You go to a website.

634
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,900
You click Buy Now.

635
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,850
And the payment's made.

636
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,950
It's instantaneous.

637
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,240
NATASHA ROONEY: Yeah.

638
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,760
That's actually a quite
interesting question.

639
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,010
So like Manu said at the
beginning, lots of us are

640
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,830
involved in this
payments stuff.

641
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,070
And Ricardo and I from the
operator's space, but Kumar

642
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,630
and Mozilla have taken a little
bit of a different

643
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,900
approach to this, where they
have said, we don't care who

644
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,470
the payment provider
is, right?

645
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,990
We're just giving you the option
to pay, which is a very

646
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,300
different stance
in this space.

647
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,580
KUMAR MCMILLAN: Yeah.

648
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,800
I mean, the thing with Bitcoin
is you can already pay with

649
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,850
Bitcoin on the web.

650
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,110
There's already web-based
wallets.

651
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,270
And so--

652
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,720
I mean, Mozilla's mozPay API,
which I think you're referring

653
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,410
to, is just one of the ways
you can pay in FirefoxOS.

654
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,000
It's not the only way.

655
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,320
So any app in FirefoxOS can
take the Bitcoin payments.

656
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,690
They would just need the
JavaScript to do it.

657
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,470
They would need the online
wallet in order to do it.

658
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,850
So it would just work.

659
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,620
But yeah, as far as mozPay, a
lot of people are interested

660
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,990
in incorporating Bitcoin.

661
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,010
It's already being asked
by a lot of people.

662
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,370
They want to see that as a
way to buy apps in the

663
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,910
marketplace, for sure.

664
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,080
Whether or not it will
happen, I don't know.

665
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,480
Because it is tough.

666
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,060
There's a lot of challenges.

667
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,530
RICARDO VARELA: While we are at
it, actually, so that you

668
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,780
get some of the data that we
wanted to get, how many people

669
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,120
here actually own Bitcoin
of any kind?

670
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,600
Because, I mean, we're like
the geekest of the geeks.

671
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,240
Everybody here should
have Bitcoin.

672
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,450
How many people have
actually done a

673
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,610
transaction with Bitcoin?

674
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:43,920
OK.

675
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,880
And how many people, when they
bought Bitcoin, actually when

676
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,620
you mean you have Bitcoin,
you bought it either in

677
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,330
[INAUDIBLE]

678
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,790
or one of those, basically
the big exchanges?

679
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,660
How many people are [INAUDIBLE],
actually?

680
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,810
OK, then you use a
smaller exchange.

681
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,570
Woohoo.

682
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,820
OK.

683
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,840
This thing's working.

684
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,550
ROB GRIMSHAW: How many people
have lost their wallet and

685
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,940
lost over $10 to $15?

686
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,980

687
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,000
There's the problem right there,
at least with Bitcoin.

688
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,250
NATASHA ROONEY: Cool.

689
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,520
Can we throw some questions
to the floor?

690
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,620
I think Marcus has got a
question at the front.

691
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,060
This is quite a contentious
topic, so if you guys want to

692
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
vote on the on-slide tool,
that would be great.

693
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,140
Because it's a strange one,
where we'd like a little bit

694
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,040
more developer feedback on how
people are feeling about

695
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,020
particular payment methods.

696
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,270
So Marcus, please.

697
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,650

698
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,290
MARCUS: OK, this one.

699
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,430
Sorry.

700
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,990
So Manu started the discussion
kind of talking about people

701
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,530
that are not in the old system,
so they're still using

702
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,770
real money, so paper money.

703
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,310
So one thing to notice, like
other people don't want to

704
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,960
move to digital money, even if
they now need to or if they

705
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,190
had to because they want
to buy a service.

706
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,700
How would they enter this
digital economy?

707
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,210
You haven't really
touched on that.

708
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,660
MANU SPORNY: Mobile devices.

709
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,610
[INAUDIBLE]

710
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,020
is completely mobile-based.

711
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,280
Mobile devices are basically the
way that a lot of people

712
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,720
in emerging nations are getting
access to the web.

713
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,470
And I mean, they have access to
the largest communication

714
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,710
network that mankind
has ever known.

715
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,400
And if we build a financial
protocol into

716
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,020
that, that's huge.

717
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,120
That's a really big thing.

718
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,330
MARCUS: You're basically
converting telcos into banks.

719
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,430
MANU SPORNY: Hopefully it's
going to be telcos and the

720
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,770
banks and companies like
Google and PayPal.

721
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,080
Everyone would have a level
playing field to effectively

722
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,160
be a financial institution
to these people.

723
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,110
RICARDO VARELA: So we know,
for example, in Europe,

724
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,310
there's actually a green paper
that's being discussed at the

725
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,120
moment in the European Union
regarding what is the role of

726
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,310
actually telcos regarding the
whole payments industry.

727
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,220
This is to regulate, explicitly,
these [INAUDIBLE]

728
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,525
payments.

729
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:56,700
And one of the things that would
have full consequences

730
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,950
for telcos if it actually ended
up being true because

731
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,330
the moment that you regulate
it as a financial product,

732
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,060
then basically you don't have
a prepaid phone account.

733
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,020
You have a value-added account
that telcos is storing, which

734
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,750
means you could go to a shop,
and they should refund your

735
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,640
money, and things like that.

736
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,710
So it has a lot of implications
regarding how you

737
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,790
handle money there.

738
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,070
But also, it also has
a lot of advantages.

739
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,070
So in this, I can actually give
one anecdote, which is

740
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,300
BlueVia, we do payments
for different--

741
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,780
basically, we're the back
end that different

742
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,720
stores connect to.

743
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,840
We do payments with Mozilla.

744
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,320
We do payments with Google.

745
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,490
And one of the things that
happened in Google recently is

746
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,750
that in the Android store,
WhatsApp, which is this famous

747
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,240
IM application, recently
decided to charge for

748
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,530
subscriptions.

749
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,630
And WhatsApp, only WhatsApp,
triplicated our transactions

750
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,400
during a period of time in Spain
because people who had

751
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,780
never entered their credit card
in Google Wallet decided

752
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,620
to pay with their mobile account
because they didn't

753
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,790
want to enter the whole
credit card thing.

754
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,720
They just said, OK.

755
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,710
There's an option to actually
pay with my phone.

756
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,800
That was the first time they
saw the option pay with my

757
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,440
phone, probably because it was
the first time that they

758
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,880
actually paid.

759
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,870
And that thing really launched
the transactions up.

760
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,140
So actually it shows that that
percentage of population, who

761
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,380
probably it was the only paid
transaction they ever did,

762
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,210
they actually used
the mobile phone.

763
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,140
MARCUS: I mean, the larger
question is--

764
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,880
you mentioned some of
the implications.

765
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,740
There are tons of legal
implications around this.

766
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,860
How are you guys going to deal
with that, especially in that

767
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,080
small community group?

768
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,090
RICARDO VARELA: Right now, it's
actually a bit of a gray

769
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,460
area because at the moment, for
example, when you charge

770
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,850
something to your phone, and
then it gets into your bill,

771
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,440
and then your bill gets
settled with your bank

772
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,060
account, in reality, the
operator never got hold of

773
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,400
that money.

774
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,180
That money has never gone
to the operator.

775
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,160
It actually only settles when
the bank pays me from your

776
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,980
bank account.

777
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,340
So in reality, your money
has always been

778
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,300
in your bank account.

779
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,270
It's more like a beautiful
ledger, what we are holding.

780
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,980
MARCUS: This wasn't what he said
initially about the 70%

781
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,390
of the people in the
world not having

782
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,436
access to a bank account.

783
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,370
The thing that I'm not
getting is that.

784
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,200
RICARDO VARELA: Yeah, but that's
because that 70% of

785
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,280
the-- so you take, for example,
a country-- this is a

786
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,260
country like Spain, where people
have got [INAUDIBLE]

787
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,840
contracts, or UK.

788
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,750
There's countries like Brazil
or most of Latin America,

789
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,340
where actually there's
three phone plans.

790
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,860
Basically, there's prepaid,
there's postpaid, the contract

791
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,480
that you're used to, and there's
[INAUDIBLE], which is

792
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,500
where I pay during
a period of time.

793
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,100
So I say, I pay 5 euros, and I'm
locked in a contract for a

794
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,930
week, that kind of thing.

795
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,990
So when you're in those systems,
most people are

796
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,710
prepaid on those markets,
by the way.

797
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,020
And what they do is
they actually pay

798
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,500
their bill on a shop.

799
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,090
They go to a shop.

800
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,260
They get a coupon, and they
load their phone.

801
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,910
So that's what they use.

802
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,120
NATASHA ROONEY: OK, yeah.

803
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,820
Complicated like a
Las Vegas hotel.

804
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,120
So we will go onto the next
question, which has come up a

805
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,240
little bit already, but Morgan,
if you're around and

806
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,870
stick your hand up.

807
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,550
Oh, there we go.

808
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,800
Very easy.

809
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,010

810
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,090
MORGAN: Hi.

811
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,550
I think part of this question
comes from our

812
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,860
host, Andrew Bets.

813
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm going to personalize
it a little.

814
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,000
The basic question is, what
needs to happen to make

815
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,900
one-click payment a reality
for everyone?

816
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,940
What I'd like you to do is
think of everyone really

817
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:05,030
broadly and include maybe
organizations like libraries

818
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,520
and their readers for whom
complete confidentiality is a

819
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,159
requirement.

820
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,159
NATASHA ROONEY: So yeah, the
one-click payment thing is

821
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:13,810
quite interesting.

822
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,639
And it was one of the things
that I was quite blown away

823
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,210
with at Google I/O this year.

824
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,639
And Cyndy, this is something
that you work on, right?

825
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,440
CYNDY LOBB: Yep.

826
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,270
So I mean, this is
a common problem.

827
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,780
Users go to hundreds of
different forms and fill out

828
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,570
the exact same information.

829
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,310
So that was kind of the
hypothesis behind

830
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,870
requestAutocomplete, which
is the new web standard

831
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:37,170
initiative that Chrome
is implementing.

832
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,310
And part of that initiative, I'm
fortunate to be able to be

833
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,830
part of it because they are
integrating Google Wallet as a

834
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,219
payment option in addition to
Chrome autofill data, but it's

835
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,860
that concept that users are
filling out the same exact

836
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,030
information again and
again and again.

837
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,020
They don't necessarily want to
hand it over to 50 different

838
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,659
merchant websites, so why does
not the browser as the

839
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,530
container hold that information
for them and

840
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,340
provide it to the different
merchant

841
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,110
websites on their behalf?

842
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:07,330
So now, requestAutocomplete is
obviously dedicated to that

843
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,810
true payments use case.

844
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,830
It is providing the user's
information to complete the

845
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,780
transaction.

846
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,210
So in terms of [INAUDIBLE].

847
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,160
I cannot pronounce--

848
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,040
[INAUDIBLE].

849
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,460
In terms of that, that gets

850
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,880
challenging in payments period.

851
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,940
So that's an interesting thread
that I was surprised

852
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,400
hasn't come up sooner because
that is one of the biggest

853
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,300
changes between those 1970s
technologies and kind of what

854
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,710
is coming out today.

855
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,100
Because there are tons
of regulations

856
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,500
around payment companies.

857
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,210
And once you're regulated, you
have to monitor for depending

858
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,330
on changes country by country,
but there's anti-money

859
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:47,910
laundering.

860
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,050
There's initiatives that
governments put in place

861
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,740
really for consumer safety that,
with this anonymous new

862
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,320
digital currency, you lose.

863
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,780
So that's definitely the
identity thread is an

864
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,440
interesting one.

865
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
MANU SPORNY: You will not be
able to be anonymous when you

866
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,800
do a payment online.

867
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,580
It is going to be highly,
highly, highly unlikely your

868
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,710
government will not
let that happen.

869
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,250
Unless you rise up and change
it, but if we look at history,

870
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,310
that doesn't happen.

871
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,150
NATASHA ROONEY: So actually, I
have a quick question to go--

872
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,680
[INAUDIBLE]

873
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,490
talking about one-click payment,
is this something

874
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,270
that FirefoxOS or Mozilla are
looking at generally?

875
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,520
And then, what if a user decides
to opt in to do not

876
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,030
track, and then would
that then--

877
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,160
how does that work?

878
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,310
[INAUDIBLE], sorry.

879
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,090
KUMAR MCMILLAN: I mean, yeah.

880
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,530
One-tap payments are definitely
something that

881
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,990
mozPay wants to support.

882
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,820
Firefox marketplace wants
to support it.

883
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,630
That doesn't mean it'll
work for everybody.

884
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,340
So that's a really harder, much
harder problem to solve.

885
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,550
Amazon already does one-click
payments.

886
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,240
I mean, it's obviously very
possible on the web.

887
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,060
It's very easy to do.

888
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,560
I think in the short term,
requestAutocomplete is the

889
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,730
best way to get there.

890
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,680
I think that's just the reality
of the web right now,

891
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,630
is that every place takes a
credit card form, and carrier

892
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,160
billing is a little bit more
complicated, but with credit

893
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,100
cards, you can have
requestAutocomplete securely

894
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,720
store your credit card number.

895
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,200
And it's two clicks maybe, but
you could just tap the button

896
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,650
and say that, yes, fill in my
credit card, and you're done.

897
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,220
And that's going to be a big
win for both sides, for

898
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,150
consumers and for
the merchants.

899
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,590
Because on mobile especially,
it's really hard to enter in

900
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,160
your credit card.

901
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,810
If you do it once on one site,
and if you have to do it an

902
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,660
infinite number of times for
each other site, that's going

903
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,900
to really suck.

904
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,820
MANU SPORNY: So I disagree
partially.

905
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,650
I think you're right
in that it is-- and

906
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,570
you were very specific.

907
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,680
You said in the short term,
that's probably going to be

908
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,180
the best solution,
requestAutocomplete.

909
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,440
And I totally agree with that.

910
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,840
But I think that is--

911
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,970
and I don't think anyone on the
panel believes this, but I

912
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,570
think it would be incredibly
shortsighted for us to stop

913
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,210
there, to say that this is the
way it should be for the next

914
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,970
5 or 10 years.

915
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,650
We really need to fix the whole
like credit card numbers

916
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,220
given to every single merchant
you visit on the web issue.

917
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,050
I mean, how many people in here
would tell your users, I

918
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,240
think you should use the exact
same password for every single

919
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,830
financial account that you have,
and whenever you go to a

920
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,410
website, whenever you want to
spend money, you give them

921
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,350
your password?

922
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,590
That's your credit
card number.

923
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:26,830
CYNDY LOBB: OK, I'm
going to jump in.

924
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,140
I'm going to jump in.

925
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,410
And that's where the Google
Wallet integration with

926
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,200
requestAutocomplete, especially
on the Chrome side,

927
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,700
does close that hole because we
do use the virtual tokens.

928
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,370
So we do protect that user's
true credit card number.

929
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,006
MANU SPORNY: But it's
proprietary to Google, right?

930
00:38:41,006 --> 00:38:41,760
CYNDY LOBB: It is.

931
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,140
NATASHA ROONEY: OK, we
probably should take

932
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,720
[INAUDIBLE].

933
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,220
CYNDY LOBB: But we are open to
integration with other browser

934
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,490
manufacturers.

935
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,180
NATASHA ROONEY: OK, we
need to take some

936
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,180
questions from the floor.

937
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:55,560
[INAUDIBLE], So yeah, somebody
can pass [INAUDIBLE]

938
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,970
a mic, please.

939
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,280
[? AUDIENCE: So ?]

940
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,190
I guess my question kind of
relates to the debate that

941
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,410
kind of was just going on, but
we've been talking about

942
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,010
responsiveness [INAUDIBLE]

943
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:04,890
clients.

944
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,965
And it's great if we move to a
world where, yeah, there is an

945
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:08,450
Open Web standard
for payments.

946
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,300
But right now, it's not that.

947
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,610
It's very fragmented.

948
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,290
Everyone's trying to push a

949
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,130
one-click solution to payments.

950
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,290
You have Amazon.

951
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,350
You have Stripe.

952
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,220
Everyone's putting a button on
your page, saying pay with me.

953
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,660
And so now we're in a--

954
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,850
for developers, our payment
form is just now cluttered

955
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,880
with pay with everything.

956
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,180
So is there kind of a strategy
for developers in a way that

957
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,150
we're not cutting into our
margins because we're not

958
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,170
giving the users the payment
method they want?

959
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,340
How do we balance that?

960
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,290
NATASHA ROONEY: This is a
web-intense [INAUDIBLE].

961
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,830
ROB GRIMSHAW: We can't just
endorse that comment because

962
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,400
referring back to the last
answer, so many of these

963
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,870
solutions for one-click payment
are essentially

964
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,830
proprietary.

965
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,440
And when you look at it from a
merchant's point of view, what

966
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,310
it amounts to is this sort of
smorgasbord of different

967
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,900
payment solutions that, one by
one, you have to kind of

968
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,030
integrate with your
own systems.

969
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,400
And each one just
delivers a tiny

970
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,660
fraction of extra payments.

971
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,120
And for a merchant
like us, which is

972
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,260
operating across borders--

973
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,370
I mean, we have subscribers
in 150 countries--

974
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,330
this is just a nightmare
because many of these

975
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,330
solutions only work in one or
two or a select number of

976
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,880
territories.

977
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,770
And it's completely
impractical.

978
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,060
We are so far away from a
one-click solution which will

979
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,205
operate seamlessly around the
globe for any merchant,

980
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:33,315
really, at the moment.

981
00:40:33,315 --> 00:40:35,860
And that's what we really need
to make things work.

982
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,710
NATASHA ROONEY: Yeah, I was
going to talk about something

983
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,970
around the [? intense ?] model
to be able to say, I just want

984
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,630
to pay, and then it's just your
chosen payment method

985
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,110
comes through.

986
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,930
But this is very similar along
the lines of what Facebook

987
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,270
tried with credits, right?

988
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,390
And then they came up against
the foreign exchange problem,

989
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:52,426
which anyone who's worked in
the financial markets will

990
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:54,790
know is just a complete
nightmare.

991
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,260
So yeah, any other thoughts
on this topic?

992
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,530
MANU SPORNY: Yeah, so I think
Cyndy and Kumar are probably

993
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,855
never going to talk to me again
after this panel, but--

994
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:04,610
CYNDY LOBB: You're sitting
dangerously close.

995
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,060
MANU SPORNY: Yes, I know.

996
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,950
And by the hole too.

997
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,460
So I think the best thing that
web developers can do is put

998
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,210
some pressure on Google and
Mozilla and PayPal and Stripe

999
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,450
and tell them that you want some
kind of unified payment

1000
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,650
mechanism that's non-proprietary
on the web.

1001
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,630
I mean, I honestly think that
is the best thing for

1002
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,300
the web right now.

1003
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,930
And I really, in your
heart of hearts, I

1004
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,640
think you agree, right?

1005
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,120
I mean, we--

1006
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,250
CYNDY LOBB: But sometimes.

1007
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,090
MANU SPORNY: Everything
[INAUDIBLE].

1008
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,570
CYNDY LOBB: [INAUDIBLE].

1009
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,900
KUMAR MCMILLAN: What I think
is really interesting about

1010
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,980
that is Mozilla and Google
are browser vendors.

1011
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,730
And I actually don't think
we have a lot of

1012
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,540
leverage to do this.

1013
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,780
I think it needs to
come from banks.

1014
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,130
MANU SPORNY: You do.

1015
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,495
You do.

1016
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:44,410
You do.

1017
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,670
I was in Dubai at a banking
conference with all the major

1018
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,630
world banks, and they are
absolutely terrified of

1019
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,960
technology companies coming in
and stealing their customers.

1020
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,620
You have so much power
to change this.

1021
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,250
I am being ab--

1022
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,530
you have so much power
to change this.

1023
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,540
NATASHA ROONEY: OK, let's
move back to the

1024
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,110
questions from the floor.

1025
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,510
Steve, here, if we can
get another mic to--

1026
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,230

1027
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,500
STEVE: Yeah, I guess it was
really just a question about

1028
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,330
what Manu said, that I can't
be anonymous on the web.

1029
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,690
In the physical world, I can
go and pay with something,

1030
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,740
cash, and be completely
anonymous.

1031
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,415
Why would I want to give up--

1032
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,020
I mean, why should I give
up that anonymity that I

1033
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,950
currently have in a
physical world?

1034
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,260
MANU SPORNY: That's a
very good question.

1035
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,850
You shouldn't if you
don't want to.

1036
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,180
But we're dealing with--

1037
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,110
I mean, you know, there's a
lot of information that's

1038
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,960
collected on us on the web.

1039
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,730
If you don't want that
information collected on you,

1040
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,370
don't get on the web.

1041
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,920
We've got issues with
PRISM, the NSA.

1042
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,000
We know how easy it is
to tap this stuff.

1043
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,020
It's very easy to track.

1044
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,570
And even Bitcoin, which is
supposed to be this pseudo

1045
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,940
anonymous protocol, people have
been able to track down

1046
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,880
spending habits, who's
spending money.

1047
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,410
So for example, if someone
steals your Bitcoin wallet,

1048
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,500
that money can't ever be used
really because if it's used,

1049
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,720
and it's tracked down to a
shipping address, then they

1050
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,960
can find you.

1051
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,280
You report your wallet as
stolen, and any money coming

1052
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,580
out of that wallet can be
tracked to the person that

1053
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,590
made any kind of physical
purchase.

1054
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,660
NATASHA ROONEY: This brings
me back to the whole

1055
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,390
do not track thing.

1056
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm still really quite
interested to know about how

1057
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,880
this would work with a mozPay
system on FirefoxOS.

1058
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,580
Because they're pushing
so much for that.

1059
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,660
RICARDO VARELA: I'll wait
for the mozPay one.

1060
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,990
If I can add only one thing to
this, the problem, as we were

1061
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,100
saying before, is basically the
whole payments is based on

1062
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,510
risk and trust.

1063
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,450
And in this case, what you're
saying, what you're doing in

1064
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,510
that financial transaction in
cash with somebody, is that

1065
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,160
the issuer, the person who's
generating the funds, aka,

1066
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,210
you, is making a transaction
with a merchant, which is at

1067
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,500
the same time the
[? acquiritor, ?]

1068
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,590
this person.

1069
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,090
And this transaction occurs in
something that we both trust,

1070
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,380
aka, government money.

1071
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,960
Because we both think
that that is

1072
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,240
actually valuable money.

1073
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,130
So this transaction has
occurred between us.

1074
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,880
You actually gave away
your identity.

1075
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,600
You gave away your identity to
this person, who actually can

1076
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,580
recognize you.

1077
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,810
And he thought that this was
enough to establish trust.

1078
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,820
So that's why they accepted
your money.

1079
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,150
In the digital world, the
problem is that this person is

1080
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,310
a server down there, and
you are a browser

1081
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,330
somewhere down here.

1082
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,350
And that trust has got to be
established between you two

1083
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,640
before those funds get changed
from your bank to their bank.

1084
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,080
And that's kind of the problem,
is that at that

1085
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,900
moment, the issuer, that other
person, that acquirer, is

1086
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,730
going to only trust something.

1087
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,570
And in general, Google will
perfectly trust your Google

1088
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,590
Wallet account.

1089
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,390
PayPal will perfectly trust
your PayPal account.

1090
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,860
And Mozilla will trust whichever
account you actually

1091
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,810
have got to be configured
in mozPay.

1092
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:42,150
But Google won't accept your
PayPal identity as being a

1093
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,890
valid identity.

1094
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,650
That is where the
problem comes.

1095
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,080
Because they don't establish
trust based

1096
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,270
on the other identity.

1097
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,510
NATASHA ROONEY: Excellent.

1098
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,350
We probably should actually
move forward.

1099
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,690
So Tom C, if you've--
oh, OK, good.

1100
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,590
There we go.

1101
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,600
TOM C: Thanks.

1102
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,140
I think if we--

1103
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,720
if I can distinguish between
anonymity and confidentiality.

1104
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,140
Somebody's coming to the library
to pay a $0.25 fine

1105
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,030
for an overdue book, and we
don't want anybody to know--

1106
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,070
we know who that person is
because we know you checked

1107
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:13,860
out the book.

1108
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,760
But I don't want anybody
else to know that you

1109
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,440
paid a fine on it.

1110
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,620
Is there a way I can do
that online for $0.25?

1111
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,340
RICARDO VARELA: No.

1112
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,400
ROB GRIMSHAW: No.

1113
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,765
MANU SPORNY: Yes.

1114
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:25,500
Yes.

1115
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,116
KUMAR MCMILLAN: I
mean, not yet.

1116
00:45:27,116 --> 00:45:28,370
MANU SPORNY: Well, I think
there is, right?

1117
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:32,020
If you use Bitcoin to do it,
and you create a one-off

1118
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,730
wallet, you could
do that payment.

1119
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,060
But I mean, that's really--

1120
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,740
it's very difficult
to do that.

1121
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,310
Technically possible, not very
feasible, which I think is the

1122
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,090
answer they were giving.

1123
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:44,280
It's not a good user
experience.

1124
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,080
NATASHA ROONEY: So Kumar--
oh, sorry, Rob, you--

1125
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,370
ROB GRIMSHAW: Some of this
stuff is not about the

1126
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,160
technology, either.

1127
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,050
I think governments around the
globe are attacking anonymity

1128
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,960
in the financial system on all
fronts for issues of taxation,

1129
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,635
money laundering, et cetera.

1130
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:01,160
And I don't think that effort
is going to stop.

1131
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,040
And as we move into an
electronics payments world, I

1132
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,500
don't think they're going
to allow big channels of

1133
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,420
anonymous payments,
whether it's

1134
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,240
technically possible or not.

1135
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:11,360
NATASHA ROONEY: Cool.

1136
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,410
All right, we should
move on now.

1137
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,550
I'm liking what people are
managing to get on the--

1138
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,050
I think we have money
bags [INAUDIBLE].

1139
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,530
CYNDY LOBB: Is this end
of the day humor?

1140
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,470
NATASHA ROONEY: [INAUDIBLE].

1141
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,360
That's fantastic.

1142
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,700
[INAUDIBLE].

1143
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,220
I kind of wish that
was the case.

1144
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,140
Unfortunately, not.

1145
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,140
So Matt Andrews, if you stick
up your hand for the next

1146
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,390
question, please.

1147
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,130

1148
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,480
MATT ANDREWS: This is another
anonymous question.

1149
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,770
I think it's pretty much been
done to death, but here we go.

1150
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,180
What are the possibilities for
decentralized peer-to-peer

1151
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,150
payments, and what security
considerations are involved in

1152
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,640
doing this?

1153
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,970
NATASHA ROONEY: So decentralized
peer-to-peer

1154
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,640
payments, and what security
considerations are involved in

1155
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,560
doing this, going back
to a similar thing.

1156
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,780
KUMAR MCMILLAN: Kumar, do you
want to start us off on this?

1157
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,770
KUMAR MCMILLAN: Sure.

1158
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,610
Well, I've been sort of in the
realm of FirefoxOS, which is a

1159
00:46:58,610 --> 00:46:59,770
mobile operating system.

1160
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:05,630
And it's really hard on mobile
devices to do something to get

1161
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,880
to a decentralized
place like that.

1162
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,460
We would need like the web
crypto API to land so that we

1163
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,480
can make sure that things are
very secure and even in memory

1164
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,370
are secure.

1165
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:23,530
And another API which is coming
is to access a secure

1166
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,880
element on certain Sim cards,
where you can actually do sort

1167
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,360
of public key exchange
type of things.

1168
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,020
All those technologies
are needed.

1169
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,320
But at the end of the day, you
could still root a device, if

1170
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,870
you were to steal it,
and then you can get

1171
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,880
access to a lot of things.

1172
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,260
So I think we're pretty far
off from it, but I think

1173
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,280
that's what would
need to happen.

1174
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,570
It would have to be something
that's would have to be this

1175
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,570
bulletproof device.

1176
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,850
Because also, if it's completely
decentralized, that

1177
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:59,400
means that you're paying with
a device, and let's say it's

1178
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,230
Bitcoin or something, and it's
not backed up on a server

1179
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,620
because it's decentralized, you
might lose that device,

1180
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,340
and then you lose
all your money.

1181
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,780
And maybe there's some
way to distribute

1182
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,450
that across many nodes.

1183
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:10,960
I don't know.

1184
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,760
But yeah.

1185
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,930
Hard problem.

1186
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,740
NATASHA ROONEY: Sort of against
the cloud pattern that

1187
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,900
seems to be happening with
lots of things, I guess.

1188
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,290
Any other points on that?

1189
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,400
MANU SPORNY: I mean, there
are already decentralized

1190
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,260
peer-to-peer payment systems
on the web, right?

1191
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,120
Bitcoin and Ripple
are two of them.

1192
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,220
You can use them.

1193
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,060
They're online wallets, so you
have to be able to get to some

1194
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,550
website to run the
transaction.

1195
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,800
But the protocols work, right?

1196
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,120
I mean, the Bitcoin's been under
attack since it ever

1197
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:46,100
came out, and by really smart
people in crypto and security

1198
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,440
areas, and no one's really
broken the protocol.

1199
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,510
So I think they're here.

1200
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,140
It's just the idea of it being
integrated directly into the

1201
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,400
browser is probably--

1202
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,950
I would expect that it would
never happen, or at least not

1203
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,160
for the next 10 to 15 years.

1204
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,160
Because the risk you run when
you put it into a browser is

1205
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
you have to end up supporting
it forever.

1206
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,640
And I don't think any of the
browser-- and I don't think it

1207
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,900
would be smart for any of the
browser vendors to build that

1208
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,420
technology in right now.

1209
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,590
Which is why the Firefox
marketplace and Telefonica are

1210
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,920
taking the approach they
are on these APIs.

1211
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,870
They're trying to be very
generic and not trying to be

1212
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:27,330
king makers when it comes
to payment technologies.

1213
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,070
It's the right way to do it.

1214
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:29,840
NATASHA ROONEY: Fantastic.

1215
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,460
Let's take another question.

1216
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,486
So Adam Sontag, if you're
in the room [INAUDIBLE].

1217
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,418
I think he's over there.

1218
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:43,710

1219
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,350
ADAM SONTAG: So this is an
anonymous question that, at

1220
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:52,470
the request of Jake Archibald, I
have mildly reformatted into

1221
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,670
rhyming verse.

1222
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,350
So one question that still needs
distilling is, what's

1223
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,940
the feasibility of
operator billing?

1224
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,360
And given that phones prefer
Wi-Fi to cell, will I have to

1225
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,166
forget this network
to buy and sell?

1226
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,642
NATASHA ROONEY: Fantastic.

1227
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:15,080
[APPLAUSE]

1228
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,680
RICARDO VARELA: Very impressive,
by the way.

1229
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,330
So my skill is not enough to
actually answer you in verse,

1230
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,360
I'm afraid.

1231
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,130
But definitely, operator billing
is something that is

1232
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,130
widely used now.

1233
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,760
We are also in the middle of,
for people who are not

1234
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,960
familiar with, in the middle
of a change of technology.

1235
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,780
So we went from premium SMS,
which is essentially I charge

1236
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,270
you for an SMS message, very
clunky, had lots of messages,

1237
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,600
really high revenue share for
the operator because it was a

1238
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,550
really old technology used
to sell ringtones

1239
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,600
and things like that.

1240
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,010
So not as good.

1241
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:44,440
To direct operator billing,
which is essentially you make

1242
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,010
a call to an API, which
is more [INAUDIBLE]

1243
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,450
for 21st century.

1244
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,320
And basically, you send me an
amount and phone number, and

1245
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,070
the phone number acts as
basically the user account.

1246
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,380
That is working now.

1247
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,930
It's actually you can pay
with that in Google.

1248
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,590
You can pay in Rim, in Nokia.

1249
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:01,090
In BlueVia, we work with at
least 20 something different

1250
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,510
providers, including Mozilla.

1251
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,510
And basically, that
is what modern

1252
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,300
operator billing is about.

1253
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,780
The problem that I see in modern
operator billing is

1254
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,960
that modern operator billing
thought to be something that

1255
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,000
you negotiate with
an operator.

1256
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,640
So you negotiate with O2.

1257
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,470
Then you go and negotiate
with Vodafone.

1258
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,840
Then you go and negotiate
with Telefonica.

1259
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,120
And the problem there is that
you have to close one account

1260
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,330
for each of these things.

1261
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,690
So one of the things that we
actually tried to start with

1262
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,460
BlueVia is to give to the
Telefonica group just one

1263
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,200
connection for all
those billings.

1264
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,710
So do what Visa does in the
case of banks, where you

1265
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,580
basically take Visa
payments, right?

1266
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,470
You don't take [INAUDIBLE],
Barclays, and

1267
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,870
don't know what payments.

1268
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,600
You take payments
from a network.

1269
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,480
So I think that is the step
that we have missing, but

1270
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,340
actually, you can do charges
to a phone number now with

1271
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,390
modern technology.

1272
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,100
NATASHA ROONEY: One of the
problems is, though, is this

1273
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,550
issue of being over Wi-Fi is
that an operator cannot

1274
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,970
recognize you as a user
if you're on a

1275
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,530
Wi-Fi network, correct?

1276
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,020
RICARDO VARELA: You only need
to know what's the phone

1277
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:01,950
number of the user.

1278
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,420
And that can happen in a
one-time transaction, which

1279
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,780
is, for example, how
Google does it.

1280
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,320
This is how Mozilla does it.

1281
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,010
Basically, if you are--

1282
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,090
operators have multiple ways
of recognizing what phone

1283
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:11,650
number you're in.

1284
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,340
For a start, you're connected
to a base station.

1285
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,220
So if you are giving your
service, we know your number.

1286
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,510
So if you're connected to the
normal network, you can

1287
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,210
identify the user through
the network.

1288
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,510
If they're connected in Wi-Fi,
then you do a fallback to SMS.

1289
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,790
Which normally is either you
send an SMS to the device with

1290
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,260
a code, or you make the device
send you an SMS, and then you

1291
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:32,750
receive it.

1292
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,150
In both cases, you establish
what is the number of the

1293
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,920
user, and then you can just
use that again and again.

1294
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,640
We have a specific API built
for this in BlueVia.

1295
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,000
In other operators, you have
to do it more manually, but

1296
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,560
you can do that.

1297
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,300
KUMAR MCMILLAN: And to be clear,
you can do it again and

1298
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,720
again because it just stores
a cookie on device.

1299
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,400
I mean, the cookie lasts 30 days
or something like that.

1300
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,390
And when you're on Wi-Fi, it
reads the cookie so it knows

1301
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,810
that you're authenticated.

1302
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,020
NATASHA ROONEY: OK.

1303
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,550
So fantastic.

1304
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,530
So can I be Montgomery
Burns, please?

1305
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,740
[INAUDIBLE].

1306
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,940
Awesome.

1307
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,840
It's getting better.

1308
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,030
Right.

1309
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,660
We only have five minutes
left, so I kind of

1310
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,460
want to close on--

1311
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,590
but we have a room of
technologists here, and I'd

1312
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,530
like to focus on a little bit of
the standards, a little bit

1313
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,880
of the what we can do.

1314
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,980
So if we just go around and have
a little bit of a chat--

1315
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,770
well, if you could all say,
give one minute on what we

1316
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,840
could do as developers
to push to the

1317
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,950
ideal payments solution.

1318
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,600
And Kumar, I'm afraid I'm
going to start with you.

1319
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,510
KUMAR MCMILLAN: Sure.

1320
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,330
As developers--

1321
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,000
NATASHA ROONEY: Or
standardizers.

1322
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,440
KUMAR MCMILLAN: Yeah.

1323
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,760
That's a tricky one.

1324
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,620
I do think, as I mentioned
before, I think to really have

1325
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,160
a sort of federated payment
system where anyone can pay

1326
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,960
with any currency, and any
merchant can accept money from

1327
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,230
anywhere, I think something
needs to come.

1328
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,400
Some API needs to be agreed upon
and implemented by banks,

1329
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,060
or something, maybe a

1330
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,960
clearinghouse, in front of banks.

1331
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,630
And I don't think that browser
vendors can do that.

1332
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,700
So I have strayed from
the topic of what

1333
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,750
developers can do.

1334
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,000
I still don't know what
developers can do.

1335
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,290

1336
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,620
NATASHA ROONEY: Ricardo?

1337
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,950
RICARDO VARELA: Well, I think
that for a start, we have to

1338
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,615
have more realistic
expectations, I

1339
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:19,470
think, in all of this.

1340
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,420
I think there's [INAUDIBLE] for
the work that we did in

1341
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,760
WAC, where you try to do a
mobile billing, in this case,

1342
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,110
for 40 something operators
across the globe, and this

1343
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:32,820
includes Asia and Africa and
Latin America, there's no way

1344
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,030
you can sink all of
those things.

1345
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,400
It's too big a problem.

1346
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,920
However, you can start
in smaller areas.

1347
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,470
You take something like
the European Union.

1348
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,950
The European Union is about to
standardize on a series of

1349
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,580
measures called SEPA.

1350
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,780
You could do, in theory, some
hub for the European Union

1351
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,770
with a specific protocol that
works across all the providers

1352
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:50,860
in the European Union.

1353
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,300
Obviously, it won't work
in Latin America.

1354
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,460
It won't work in China.

1355
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,450
But it's something.

1356
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,250
So we start trying to
standardize there, and we try

1357
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,640
to push for a standard idea or
a standard way that different

1358
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,580
providers can implement that
there, which is how it

1359
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,120
normally happens.

1360
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,640
Banks didn't go and try to
standardize on this type of

1361
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,830
thing worldwide.

1362
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,970
They standardized in European
Union, more or less.

1363
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,790
And then let's see
how it extends.

1364
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,600
Or you do two networks, and then
we talk a common protocol

1365
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,690
among our networks.

1366
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,490
That would be fine.

1367
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:17,190
The thing is that you
need those initial

1368
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,330
solutions to be there.

1369
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:22,250
So requestAutocomplete or mozPay
are initial tries of

1370
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,310
getting to that standard API.

1371
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,950
Just use them, feedback to them,
and saying I'm lacking

1372
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,380
this thing.

1373
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,190
So requestAutocomplete doesn't
support [INAUDIBLE] billing.

1374
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,570
MozPay, we're going to do
another iteration now.

1375
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:34,250
Whichever thing that we have,
just feedback to that, and

1376
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,080
start with that smaller
goal before we get

1377
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,210
to the bigger goal.

1378
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,110
ROB GRIMSHAW: I'm actually very
excited about some of the

1379
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,700
things that Ricardo
is talking about.

1380
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,400
I believe fundamentally that the
solutions are going to be

1381
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,080
mobile-based ultimately.

1382
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,270
We're almost to the point where
there are more mobile

1383
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,180
devices than people
on the planet.

1384
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,300
There's far more people with
mobiles than there are with

1385
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,970
bank accounts, for example.

1386
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:02,900
And if some of the things that
Ricardo is talking about, the

1387
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,970
development of a network and
a sort of global standard

1388
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,020
network for payments across
major mobile operators can

1389
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:16,480
develop, then I can see how a
merchant like us can take

1390
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,040
payments on mobile devices
potentially from a marketplace

1391
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,340
of billions of people
around the globe.

1392
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,440
And that's very,
very exciting.

1393
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,670
And if you think about
it, what you've

1394
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,560
got there is a chain.

1395
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,870
All these devices in some
way are linked up

1396
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:31,780
to a source of value.

1397
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,220
Whether that's a bank account or
whether that's a prepaid or

1398
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,160
whatever, the chain of value
is already there.

1399
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,320
If you can create the standard
across the top of it, maybe

1400
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,060
starting in the EU or the US
or whatever, which then a

1401
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,530
merchant like us can then
hook into, that

1402
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,440
can deliver the solution.

1403
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,500
And I don't think you have to
think about utopian scenarios

1404
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,600
in order to get there.

1405
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,110
It's not difficult to see how
this step can be taken.

1406
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:00,060
NATASHA ROONEY: Yeah, so from
my point of view, I think

1407
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,790
that's an important issue.

1408
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,000
Lots of users think about what
would be great for the users.

1409
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,030
And I think the way that you're
going to get the thing

1410
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:11,010
that you want as a user is to
influence from a merchant

1411
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,610
standpoint or from the bank
standpoint or from the

1412
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:14,820
standardization standpoint.

1413
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,350
And that's my takeaway, is that,
OK, if you want your

1414
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,560
user goals, you go for it.

1415
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,000
But you put a slant on it and
sell it up to those other

1416
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,290
people that makes them think
that they're getting

1417
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,510
something, when you're actually
getting something,

1418
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,790
and that's the way to
get what you want.

1419
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,920
So lifestyle tips.

1420
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,600
Manu, go for it.

1421
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,480
MANU SPORNY: So anybody in
here that's interested in

1422
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,640
payments, the thing that you
could do is join the web

1423
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,490
payments group.

1424
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:38,420
Join the discussion.

1425
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,400
It's completely open.

1426
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,160
Anyone can join and
participate.

1427
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,850
Educate yourself about it, and
help us actually figure out

1428
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:50,270
what standards to build, what
to build that you can use.

1429
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,250
The other point I wanted to kind
of make is playing off of

1430
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,230
Kumar's bank-based thing.

1431
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:58,900
I did spend the last week
at the World Banking

1432
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,995
Conference in Dubai.

1433
00:58:00,995 --> 00:58:03,080
No bank is working on this.

1434
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,410
I guarantee you.

1435
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:06,920
I had high level, low
level, all kinds of

1436
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,940
discussions with them.

1437
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,020
The standard bank system is
written in COBOL or Fortran.

1438
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,550
It was implemented in
1987 [INAUDIBLE]

1439
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,860
through 1992.

1440
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,750
They're still running
that code base.

1441
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,020
They are absolutely mortified
of doing any kind of large

1442
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,060
change to their system.

1443
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,930
So this solution is not going
to come from the banks.

1444
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,210
It could come from the
mobile operators.

1445
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:31,620
It could come from the
people like Google

1446
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,490
Wallet, PayPal, Stripe.

1447
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,070
But at some point, all of us
are going to have to band

1448
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:39,320
together in some kind of clump
and push something forward.

1449
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,430
It's definitely not going
to be the banks

1450
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,590
that do that though.

1451
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,650
NATASHA ROONEY: So throw
yourself into the

1452
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,030
standardization.

1453
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,740
Finally, Cyndy.

1454
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,230
CYNDY LOBB: Real quick, because
I know everyone's

1455
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,730
ready to be done.

1456
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,810
No, just really use mozPay.

1457
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,460
Use requestAutocomplete.

1458
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,190
Even though it is technology
from the '70s, it is what

1459
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,210
everyone is still using.

1460
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:59,750
And there's plenty of room to
improve that '70s technology

1461
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,160
experience on the web as we try
and lay a foundation and

1462
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,530
segue into more different
technologies.

1463
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,270
But definitely
requestAutocomplete, mozPay.

1464
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,930
Participate.

1465
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,640
We are trying to
make it better.

1466
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,150
NATASHA ROONEY: OK, excellent.

1467
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,910
So that's [INAUDIBLE].

1468
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,000
Thank you so much to
the panelists.

1469
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,300
[INAUDIBLE].

1470
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:24,982
[APPLAUSE]
