You registered for Edge and we sent you an invite, but you haven't used it.  If you still want to, you need to buy your ticket soon, as we're now issuing more invitations to people on our waitlist.  If you received a reserved ticket invitation, remember your exclusivity period has expired - so although you can still buy a ticket, your invitation <strong>no longer guarantees you a place</strong>.

And there are a lot of people on the waitlist.  As of right now, it's {waitlist}.

Edge is a new kind of one-day conference on advanced web technologies for developers and browser vendors. Presented by FT Labs, Google, and Facebook.  Tickets cost Â£50, which will pay speakers travel expenses and help us ensure that the venue is full without having to oversell.  Any money we have left will be donated to an open source project selected by conference delegates during the event.

See you there!
