The interest in Edge has been fantastic, and we're unable to fit everyone in.  We will continue to issue invitations until all tickets are sold, and tickets are available on a FIRST COME FIRST SERVED BASIS to anyone with an invitation.

Edge is a new kind of one-day conference on advanced web technologies for developers and browser vendors. Presented by FT Labs, Google, and Facebook.  Tickets cost Â£50, which will pay speakers travel expenses and help us ensure that the venue is full without having to oversell.  Any money we have left will be donated to an open source project selected by conference delegates during the event.
